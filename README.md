This is the repository consisting of the code for all of the PCSMA assignments. The assignments are labelled by their commits. 

First Assignment - Instructions to run the code
==============================================

Step 1: Start the server. It is a simple java server and should run in eclipse.

Step 2: Determine the IP of your machine using the command 'ifconfig -a'. Once that is done, feed it to the Android App in the MainActivity.java class in the line that says "socket = new Socket("192.168.1.4", 8888);".

Step 3: Upload the app to an android phone and test normally.

Assumptions:
-----------

1. I am not running a server on apache or anything like that. The server is custom built and meant specifically for this assignment. It will not always be on.
2. Data will only be sent once the stop button has already been pressed. If the file does not exist and the send button is pressed, data will not be sent.
3. 'Enter' characters will be ignored while sending data.
4. The IP address has been hardcoded into the code.
